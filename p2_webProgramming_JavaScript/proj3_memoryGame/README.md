## Rules

* There are eight pairs of cards on the game board.
* Once you click on a card, it will flip and show its icon.
* When you click on another card and after that card flips:
	* In case this card icon matches the one that was flipped earlier then both cards will turn blue.
    * In case both cards don't match then both cards will be flipped on their back again.
* Every a pair of cards you flip will be considered as a move and the number of them will be incremented and showed on the game board.
	* If you have more than 16 moves you will be loose one star, and after 24, you will be loose two stars.
* After you successfully manage to match all eight pairs of cards, a popup window will congratulate you and show how many moves and how much time have you spent.
