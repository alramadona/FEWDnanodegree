			<p class="card-summary">The Komodo dragon, also known as the Komodo monitor, 
				is a member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae, the largest living species of lizard.</p>

			<p class="card-description">Their unusually large size has been attributed to island gigantism 
				since no other carnivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where they live. 
				However, recent research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better understood 
				as representative of a relict population of very large varanid lizards that once lived across 
				Indonesia and Australia, most of which, along with another megafauna, died out after 
				the Pleistocene (likely as a result of human activity).</p>
